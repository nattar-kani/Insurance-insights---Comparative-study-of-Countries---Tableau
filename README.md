# Insurance insights - Comparative study of Countries

- Created a dashboard for my Course end project to compare all the parameters mentioned for different countries, to strategize market penetration and to target new customers.  
- Used data blending to connect both the given datasets.  
##**Steps to Perform**
- Create a geographic map showing the countries' fields. Color the map based on the income column from the secondary dataset  
- Create a KPI Table to show the comparison between the selected period and the period prior to the selected one  
- Create two parameters for Year Selection and Category Selection  
- Category parameter includes life insurance share, market share, penetration, ratio of reinsurance accepted, and retention ratio  
- Create a calculated field to calculate the Growth %  
- Create a table to show these values  
- Title should be updated based on the category selection  
- Create Growth Indicator Shapes based on the Growth %  
- Growth indicator displays Negative, No Change, and Positive as values and corresponding shapes against it  
- Create a trend line to show the selected category values  
- The line shows an arrow or triangle at the last mark  
- Create a dashboard filter for income group to be applied for all charts with the filter action enabled in the map as well
